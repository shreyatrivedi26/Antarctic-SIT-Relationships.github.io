Antarctic Sea-ice Thickness: Spatio-Temporal Variability and its Relationship with Large-Scale Southern Hemispheric Atmospheric Circulations

## Introduction:
1. Sea ice Thickness (SIT) has received limited attention  despite its importance in indicating absolute sea ice changes in the Southern Ocean.
2. Existing studies understanding sea-ice relationships between atmospheric components and Antarctic sea-ice have only focused on the surface parameters such sea ice concentration (SIC), area or extent. 

## Motivation of the Study:  
Results from my previous studies highlighted covariability between SIT and SIC:

## Objectives/Research Questions:
1. Identifying reasons for covariances between SIT and SIC:
    _How do spatial and temporal SIT patterns look around the Antarctic?
    How are they different from SIC patterns?_
    
2. Understanding the significance of atmospheric drivers on sea-ice: 
_    How are SIT and atmospheric mode in the southern hemisphere related? 
    What are the primary dictating factor for SIT distribution in each region? 
    Does SIC respond differently to them?_
