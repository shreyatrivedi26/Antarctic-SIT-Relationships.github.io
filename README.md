Antarctic Sea-ice Thickness: Spatio-Temporal Variability and its Relationship with Large-Scale Southern Hemispheric Atmospheric Circulations

## Introduction:
1. Sea ice Thickness (SIT) has received limited attention  despite its importance in indicating absolute sea ice changes in the Southern Ocean.
2. Existing studies understanding sea-ice relationships between atmospheric components and Antarctic sea-ice have only focused on the surface parameters such sea ice concentration (SIC), area or extent. 

## Motivation of the Study:  
Results from my previous studies highlighted covariability between SIT and SIC:

## Objectives/Research Questions:
1. Identifying reasons for covariances between SIT and SIC:
    _How do spatial and temporal SIT patterns look around the Antarctic?
    How are they different from SIC patterns?_
    
2. Understanding the significance of atmospheric drivers on sea-ice: 
_    How are SIT and atmospheric mode in the southern hemisphere related? 
__    What are the primary dictating factor for SIT distribution in each region? 
_    Does SIC respond differently to them?

**EOF1:**
**SIT:** Opposing spatial anomaly pattens  in Weddell-Bellingshausen and Ross-Amundsen.PC1 shows a steady positive increase from 1979-2000s and strengthens 2000 onwards.Maybe linked to broader climate phenomenon such as SAM or long-term atmospheric changes.

**SIC:** Alternating Zonal patterns around the Antarctic.PC1 shows strong interannual variabilityïƒ  higher magnitudes and amplitudes (1990 onwards).Thermodynamic reasons, with greater melting at the ice edge. 

**EOF2:**
Similar opposing anomaly patterns in both the parameters. For SIT, changes are throughout the ice-pack while for SIC, they are mostly concentrated at the ice edge.
More oscillatory nature with strong interannual variability.
May be associated with more localized or shorter-term variability (such as ENSO, ASL, ZW3).


3. **Key Atmospheric Influences:** During the Advance season, ZW3, SOI, and ASL significantly drive SIT variability. Regression residuals increase notably when these indices are excluded, highlighting their importance.

4. **Dynamic vs. Thermal Drivers:** SIT is primarily influenced by dynamic atmospheric factors, whereas SIC patterns are more strongly affected by thermal processes like sea surface warming and ice melt.
