Antarctic Sea-ice Thickness: Spatio-Temporal Variability and its Relationship with Large-Scale Southern Hemispheric Atmospheric Circulations

## Introduction:
Sea ice Thickness (SIT) has received limited attention  despite its importance in indicating absolute sea ice changes in the Southern Ocean.
Existing studies understanding sea-ice relationships between atmospheric components and Antarctic sea-ice have only focused on the surface parameters such sea ice concentration (SIC), area or extent. 

## Motivation of the Study:  
Results from my previous studies highlighted covariability between SIT and SIC:
